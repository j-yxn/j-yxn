Welcome to my GitHub profile! ‚öôÔ∏è I am currently a high school senior interested in data and applied sciences, particularly in systems and hardware analysis. I will attend the University of Virginia this fall and plan to double major in Applied Statistics and Computer Science.
##
I am always eager to learn and grow, seeking out opportunities to expand my skill set and embrace new challenges. My current experience includes <strong>Java, Python, and HTML/CSS</strong> üíª, and I am committed to refining my expertise in these languages while also exploring other areas within the field of STEAM. I am taking/taken a variety of rigorous courses that correlate well with STEAM, including Multivariable Calculus, AP Physics C: Mechanics, and AP Computer Science A. Additionally, I am heavily involved in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics as the Build Lead for <strong>Team 1885</strong>- check out our past and current season results! üî©
